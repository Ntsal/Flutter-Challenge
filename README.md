# Flutter-Challenge

Mobile developers face challenges almost everyday during development: performance, security, backwards compatibility, testing... And mainly refactoring for it's own or legacy code. This repository contains a project description to face a small challenge where the developer should build the app along with some new features, detect (and implement) patterns, add tests, and do a clean code.

This app uses an API to get data and preview it. Your challenge is to build the app however you see fit!

## Getting Started

Your task is to build an app that retrieves a list of some music artists from an API. The app has a signup page, a page for showing a list of the artists, the profile for each artist.

API URL: <a href="https://run.mocky.io/v3/4896603c-adcb-4be6-9328-d081553b1fe2">https://run.mocky.io/v3/4896603c-adcb-4be6-9328-d081553b1fe2</a>

This behaviour should be done in three diffent screens, one for signup, one for list and one for profile of the artist:

<p>
  <a href="./screens/signup.png"><img src="screens/signup.png" width="300" /></a>
  <a href="./screens/signup1.png"><img src="./screens/signup1.png" width="300" /> </a>
  <a href="./screens/artist-list.png"><img src="./screens/artist-list.png" width="300" /></a>
  <a href="./screens/artist-profile.png"><img src="./screens/artist-profile.png" width="300" /></a>
  <a href="./screens/artist-profile1.png"><img src="./screens/artist-profile1.png" width="300" /></a>
</p>
